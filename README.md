The code implements the bisection method, which is a root-finding algorithm.

Create a function that takes four parameters:
fx: The function for which we want to find the root
a and b: The initial interval bounds
e: The error tolerance (how close to zero we want to get)
Check if the function changes sign between a and b. If not, there's no guaranteed root in this interval.
The loop continues until the interval size becomes smaller than the error tolerance.
Calculate the midpoint c and evaluate the function at this point.
If the function value at the midpoint is close enough to zero, we've found the root. This narrows down the interval by half, choosing the side where the root lies.
If the loop completes without finding an exact root, it returns the midpoint of the final small interval.
The code tests the function with f(x) = x - 5, looking for a root between 2 and 8, with a tolerance of 0.001.
This prints the found root and verifies how close f(root) is to zero.

The bisection method is simple and robust, guaranteed to converge for continuous functions, but it can be slower than some other methods like Newton-Raphson.
